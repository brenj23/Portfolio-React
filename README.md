# 20 React: React Portfolio

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Description
A portfolio webpage of some projects I have done. I used React to code project and email.js for contact page for individuals to contact me by email directly from webpage.
